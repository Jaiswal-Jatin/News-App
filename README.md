# simpal_app

This is a personal News app built using Flutter, with state management handled by GetX and GetX CLI for clean architecture.
It fetches the latest news using a new and fast News API.

The app is lightweight, fast, and designed for personal use, helping me stay updated with the latest headlines in a simple and user-friendly interface.
